# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hi, I'm Casey McGrath, a financial risk management professional transitioning into software engineering. With experience across global financial hubs like NYC, London, Hong Kong, and Australia, I'm now blending my finance expertise with coding skills developed through self study and the Columbia University Engineering Bootcamp.

This GitHub and my [Portfolio](http://www.riskthatbiscuit.com) showcase my journey in combining finance and tech. I'm eager to learn, collaborate, and build as I shift my career focus.

If you're interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to reach out.

Best,
Casey McGrath
