# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hello and thanks for stopping by. This is my GitHub repository, where I'm sharing my journey in finance and coding. I've got a background in financial risk management, having worked in various cities across the globe like Australia, Hong Kong, London, and currently in NYC.

I've always had a knack for numbers, and throughout my career, I've dabbled in coding. Recently, I started the Columbia Bootcamp to formalize my skills and make a move into software engineering.

This GitHub space is where I'm focusing on merging my financial insights with the world of coding. You'll find a mix of projects that reflect my interests, including a few that I'm particularly fond of:

1. **Portfolio Risk Analyzer:** A tool to assess risk in investments.
2. **Algorithmic Trading Bot:** An experiment in coding meets finance.
3. **Financial Dashboard:** Visualizing complex financial data in a more digestible way.

I'm here to learn, collaborate, and gradually transition my career. If any of this resonates with you or you're interested in connecting, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,
Casey McGrath
